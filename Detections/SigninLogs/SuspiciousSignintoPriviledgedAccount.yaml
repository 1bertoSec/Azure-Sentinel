  'This query will help detect any Sign-in's from non-compliant/unknown device or from device registered without MFA(Multi-factor Authentication) to privileged account using pre-built watchlist to identify the accounts.
  Azure Sentinel provides the ability to create pre-built watchlist templates, that can be customized for your environment and used during investigations.
